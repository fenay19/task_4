# Task 4 - Machine Learning Pipeline

This project is part of a machine learning learning module and demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline using Python and scikit-learn. The code is written in a Jupyter Notebook and includes steps such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a predictive model using a structured dataset. The exact nature of the dataset (classification or regression) can be identified by reviewing the target variable in the notebook.

## 🧠 Key Steps in the Notebook

1. **Data Loading**:  
   Loads data using `pandas.read_csv()` or similar method.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   Visualizes data distributions, missing values, and correlations using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Normalization or scaling

4. **Model Building**:  
   Trains machine learning models using `scikit-learn`.  
   Common models include:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

5. **Evaluation**:  
   Uses metrics like Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

6. **Prediction**:  
   Applies the trained model to test/validation datasets.
